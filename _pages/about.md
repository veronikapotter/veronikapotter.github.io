I’m a computer scientist interested in using technology for social good.

Currently, I’m a graduate computer science student advised by [Dr. Stephen Intille](https://ccs.neu.edu/home/intille/) in the [mHealth Research Lab](https://www.mhealthgroup.org/) at Northeastern University. As a graduate researcher I am exploring how minimal wearable sensor data, such as smartwatch acceleration data, can accurately and reliably detect human activity to support better population-wide health insights. I have led the release of an open dataset containing wearable sensor data from 250+ individuals, along with pre-trained machine learning classifiers to support future work by engineers and health researchers. I have also conducted a systematic review of wrist-acceleration-based activity recognition research to identify trends and gaps in the field. In my current work, I am implementing, evaluating, and publicly releasing key activity recognition models to provide health researchers with realistic performance estimates and usable models. Looking forward, I aim to continue working at the intersection of data analytics, science communication, and social impact. 

Outside of the office and off the screen you can find me making ceramics, quilting the tiniest quilts, or tide-pooling for marine creatures.
